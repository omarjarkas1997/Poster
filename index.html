				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p ali>The introduction of Smart Contracts is paving the way for a new paradigm of financial arrangements
					and interactions. With the security, immutability, and decentralization characteristics of the
					Ethereum platform, Smart Contracts are changing the way deals are made. However, those same
					characteristics bode some serious restrictions when developing such contracts. Due to the immutable
					coupling of contract code with financial values, code written should always be of ultimate
					efficiency, security, and correctness. Formal Verification has emerged as the prominent method for
					testing the correctness of contracts before deploying them to the chain. However, finding the right
					mix between the formal methods, design patterns, and testing tradeoffs are often challenging and
					require extra implementation. This paper introduces a parser that attempts to bridge the gap between
					a general formal verification language that is gaining plenty of traction in the past years, Dafny,
					with the most prominent programming language used to develop Smart Contracts. By using a
					specification model for accurately modeling Smart Contract in Dafny, the parser has only to inject
					such model and Dafny standard idioms and best practice. </p>

				<h3>Framework and Parser</h3>
				<p>
					In this project, we introduce a formal template and parser to implement a formal verification model
					using the Dafny Language. The Template is built on the work of a <a
						href="https://github.com/chthonic7/solidity-to-dafny">Github Repository</a> to try to
					implement a specification model in Dafny for Ethereum Smart Contracts. The Specification model is in
					the context of the global namespace of the Solidity language that enables it to interact with other
					contracts, users, and the blockchain environment. The specification model supplies the formal
					verification language with the adequate functions to mimic the Ethereum Virtual Machine Environment
					by providing the global function and variables used in Solidity.
				</p>

				<img src="assets/pic2.png" class="img-fluid m-4" alt="describe any images in the alt text">

				<p>The implementation of the specification model allows the efficient reasoning and formalization of the
					contract's code. However, the Dafny language uses a series of recommended best practices and
					standard idioms for effective verification. The Parser attempts to the facilitate a more smooth
					implementation of such practices. The parser essential extracts the important information from Smart
					Contracts such as its name, variables, and functions and attempts to build a skeleton from the
					information while implementing the specification model and the practices mentioned. </p>

				<h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
				<p>In 2014, the Ethereum platform along with its virtual machine emerged. Ethereum came to solve many
					problems faced in Bitcoin that made it limited in potential and support Smart Contracts. Smart
					Contracts are nothing but computer programs deployed on the blockchain and executed by the virtual
					machine. Such applications can facilitate the smooth collaboration between separate organizations
					and independent parties. They are called contracts due to the blockchain’s ability to guarantee
					enforceability of specific predefined condition and agreement mimicking real-world contracts.

				<h3>Formal Verification</h3>
				<p>Smart Contracts give a good example of applications where failure is unacceptable. Similar to
					the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5">Ariane 5 Rocket</a> Rocket, simple software
					bugs can cause significant damage and loss. While formal
					methods are not new, such software incidents are pushing more and more industries to consider formal
					verification as a means to eliminate whole classes of unpredicted errors and capture all possible
					behavior through specifying them. In contrast to dynamic verification, formal verification is the
					process of using static analysis based on a mathematical proof transformation to prove the
					correctness of hardware and software processes. The process includes defining clear formal
					specification semantics in the form of a brief mathematical description of the algorithm to satisfy
					clear behavior properties. Such descriptions must outline clear and concise code behavior based upon
					mathematical models and theorems. Often the specification of high-level code can be
					translated into other high-level languages that support specification semantics-based and deductive
					and inductive reasoning. However, such specification can be extremely hard to model accurately and
					deduce due to the generality of the system, hence, finding an adequate design formalization
					technique can also be difficult. Also, while formal verification's end goal is to prove the
					correctness of algorithms and systems by implementing code specification, there are many approaches
					introduced in the field to tackle the challenge of correctness. However, one of the reason why
					formal verification is very suitable to verify Smart Contract application is due to its independence
					of simulation environments and to prove correctness.</p>

				<p>The YouTube video demonstrate the use and implementation of the global name-space template and the

					use of the template is Dafny converted contracts as well as the vulnerabilities detected and the
					process of verification while show Dafny recommended design patterns and best practice.
					To implement the template as well as Dafny's best practice a simple parser was constructed in Java
					taken is Smart Contracts and output a Dafny file that include the all the method and variables of
